The solution involves ensuring consistent unit usage within the `calc()` function or employing a more predictable approach.  Instead of mixing percentages and pixels, either use a consistent unit (e.g., only pixels) or calculate the percentage beforehand, using `em` or `rem`  to maintain proper scaling. 

Here's a corrected version:

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
#myElement {
  width: calc(50% - 20px);
  /* Or, for better scaling and consistency*/
  /*width: calc(50vw - 2em);*/ 
}
```
This ensures the calculation is performed using consistent units, preventing unexpected results.
